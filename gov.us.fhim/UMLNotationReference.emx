          <body>An information model is a structured specification of the information within a                 specific domain of interest. It expresses the classes of information required and                 the properties of those classes, including attributes, relationships, constraints,                 and states. In HL7, the scope of a domain of interest ranges from the domain of the                 entire system of health services to the specific context of a set of information                 exchanges to meet a particular identified business purpose. The FHIM model relies on                 the following three HL7 Version 3 (V3) standards: the Reference Information Model                 (RIM), abstract data types and vocabulary specifications. The HL7 RIM is a critical                 component and is the root of all information models and structures developed as part                 of the V3 development process. The RIM consists of classes assigned to one or more                 subject area packages. Attributes, Relationships, and State Machines are associated                 with the classes. The following is a summary of these conventions based on the                 application of HL7 Version 3 design principles to the development of FHIM                 information domains. Note that HL7 RIM classes are color coded according their main                 class type or stereotype.</body>

            <body>The &amp;amp;apos; back-bone&amp;amp;apos; of the RIM is used to express the clinical and administrative                   content of health care, and is comprised of six classes:   Act   which represents                   the actions that are executed and must be documented as health care is provided.                   Act classes are depicted in pale Red on the UML diagrams;   Participation   which                   expresses the context for an act in terms such as who performed it, for whom it                   was done, where it was done, etc. Participation classes are depicted in Blue on                   UML diagrams;   Entity   which represents the physical things and beings that are                   of interest to, and take part in health care. Entity classes are depicted in Green                   on the UML diagrams;   Role   which establishes the roles that entities play as                   they participate in health care acts. Role classes are depicted in Yellow on the                   UML diagrams;   ActRelationship   which represents the binding of one act to                   another, such as the relationship between an order for an observation and the                   observation event as it occurs. ActRelationships may only appear as stereotyped                   associations between classes; and   RoleLink   which represents relationships                   between individual roles. RoleLink classes are depicted in pale Yellow/Green on                   UML diagrams. Three of these classes   Act, Entity and Role   are further                   represented by a set of specialized classes or sub-types.</body>

            <body> A stereotype is one of three types of extensibility mechanisms in the Unified                   Modeling Language (UML). They allow designers to extend the vocabulary of UML in                   order to create new model elements, derived from existing ones, but that have                   specific properties that are suitable for a particular problem domain or otherwise                   specialized usage. The nomenclature is derived from the original meaning of                   stereotype, used in printing. For example, when modeling a network we could                   symbols for representing routers and hubs. By using stereotyped nodes you can make                   these things appear as primitive building blocks. Graphically, a stereotype is                   rendered as a name enclosed by guillemets (     ) and placed above the name of                   another element. In addition or alternatively it may be indicated by a specific                   icon. The icon image may even replace the entire UML symbol. We will use the                    guillemets  notation in this publication.</body>

            <body>The HL7 vocabulary model allows a coded attribute to be associated with either                   a coded concept, a coding system or a coding system and a value set consisting of                   allowable coded concepts. An important aspect of both the FHIM and HL7 models is                   that they explicitly link &amp;amp;apos; coded concepts&amp;amp;apos; to their corresponding vocabularies.                   This is necessary for two reasons: first because external terminologies (such as                   SNOMED) already exist and must be referenced by the model; and second, because to                   model those terminologies in UML would be both redundant and overly complex. It is                   far more efficient to simply link to the existing terminology. The structural                   model, expressed in UML, and the terminology are two sides of the same coin; one                   cannot fully describe the relevant concepts without having both models. Both                   models must be designed to complement each other.</body>

            <body>Each class within the RIM represents information about a concept that is                   documented and communicated within the health care environment. A class is an                   abstraction of things or concepts that are subjects of interest in a given                   application domain. Classes are the people, places, roles, things, and events                   about which information is kept. Classes have a name, description, sets of                   attributes, relationships, and states. The instances of classes are called                   objects. While classes represent categories of concepts, people and things,                   objects represent the individual things themselves. Classes relate to other                   classes in various ways. Such relationships are of two types: Generalization and                   Association.</body>

            <body>A generalization relationship is a connection between classes (as opposed to                   objects). It is an association between two classes (a superclass and a subclass)                   in which the subclass is derived from the superclass (i.e., the superclass                   generalizes the subclass and the subclass is a specialization of the superclass).                   The subclass inherits all properties from the superclass, including attributes,                   relationships and states. Instances of a subclass are also instances of the                   superclass. In addition, the subclass has other properties that are unique to the                   subclass. Each subclass may in turn have subclasses of its own. Thus, a class can                   be both a subclass of its superclass and a superclass of its subclasses. A                   generalization usually has multiple specializations. However, not all of the                   conceptual specializations have to be represented in the model. Only the concepts                   that warrant special properties (e.g., attributes, relationships, states) are                   modeled as specialized classes. If all specializations are fully enumerated as                   subclasses in the model, the superclass is considered to be an &amp;amp;apos; abstract&amp;amp;apos; class.                   An abstract class is designed only as a parent class from which implementable                   child classes may be derived. Abstract classes are often used to represent                   abstract concepts or entities. The incomplete features of the abstract class are                   shared by a group of subclasses which add different variations of the missing                   pieces. An abstract class is never instantiated directly, but only through one of                   its specializations. </body>

            <body>An association defines a relationship between a class to another class or to                   itself, or a connection between two objects (instances of classes). Associations                   in the HL7 information models have at least two ends (source and target). The                   target end of an association must contain an end name (endName) and the                   multiplicity/cardinality of the relationship. Associations may be directed (one                   way) or bi-directional. If the association is directed, the association line has                   an arrow at the target end of the association. If the association is                   bi-directional, both association end names must be specified (on source and                   target), but no arrows are included on the association. Each end of the                   association instance connects with one and only one object. However, one object                   may be associated with more than one object of the same class by the same                   association. In this case, multiple association instances exist, each connecting                   exactly two objects. The number of instances of an association that can connect to                   one object is regulated by the multiplicity/cardinality of the association. An                   association multiplicity/cardinality specifies the minimum and maximum number of                   objects of each class participating in the association. Multiplicity/cardinality                   is usually expressed as a pair of numbers on the end of the association e.g.,                   [minimum..maximum]. The lower bound minimum is usually zero or one. The upper                   bound maximum is greater or equal to minimum, but is usually one, or unlimited. To                   specify that an association (or attribute) can repeat any number of times, the                   asterisk (*) notation is used. The default is [1..1] if not otherwise specified.                   In the UML diagrams included within this publication, multiplicity is displayed                   without the [square brackets] on association endNames, but within the classes                   themselves, the square bracket notation is used to describe the multiplicity on                   attributes.</body>

            <body>Class attributes are the core components of an information model. The                   attributes are the source for all the information content of HL7. The majority of                   attributes are descriptive and depict aspects of classes that are important for                   communication between healthcare systems. Beside the descriptive attributes, there                   are four special kinds of attributes in the information model of note: identifier,                   classifier, structural and state attributes. a. Identifier Attributes: Identifier                   attributes can be used to identify an instance of a class. (Sometimes more than                   one attribute may be needed to identify an instance of a class.) Identifier                   attributes always have a value and the values of identifier attributes are unique                   among all instances of the class. Since identity is static, values of identifier                   attributes never change. Identifier attributes are assigned the  set of instance                   identifier data type and generally have the name &amp;amp;apos;id&amp;amp;apos; which allow for multiple                   identifiers to be specified. Examples of identifier attributes from the RIM                   include Entity.id and Act.id, which uniquely identify a particular Entity or Act                   respectively. In each case, the identifier attributes are a set of instance                   identifiers. This indicates that there may be multiple, unique identifiers for an                   Entity or Act. Entity identifiers might include device serial numbers, social                   security numbers, driver license numbers, and others. Act identifiers might                   include placer accession numbers, filler accession numbers, and others. b.                   Classifier Attributes: The classifier attributes are a critical aspect of classes                   forming the backbone of the RIM (Entity, Role, Act, Participation, ActRelationship                   and RoleLink classes). Classifier attributes are named &amp;amp;apos;classCode&amp;amp;apos;. The classifier                   attributes provide a great flexibility and extensibility in the information model.                   The vocabulary for classifier attributes include an entry for each specialization                   of the backbone class. For example, the vocabulary domain specified for                   Entity.classCode includes living subject, organization, place and material. The                   vocabulary domain may also include entries that are not explicitly expressed as                   classes in the model. For example, group is a valid Entity classCode (or                   specialization of Entity) but does not appear in the RIM as a class. c. Structural                   Attributes: Structural attributes are attributes whose coded values are needed to                   fully interpret the classes they classify. They are four mandatory attributes and                   include the classifier attribute, ClassCode described in the previous paragraph.                   The other three are moodCode, typeCode and determinerCode. All four are not found                   in every class (neither Acts or Entities use determinerCode). There is a bounded                   vocabulary managed by HL7 for each use of a structural attribute. For instance,                   for Act, there is an actMood vocabulary. d. State Attributes: A state attribute is                   used in subject classes (subject classes are those that a Technical Committee                   designates as the central focus of a collection of messages). A state attribute                   contains a value that indicates the current state (named condition) of the class.                   A subject class must have only one state attribute. The state attribute must be                   assigned the data type &amp;amp;apos; set of code value&amp;amp;apos; that allows multiple state flags to be                   specified. State attributes are named status_cd and are associated with vocabulary                   domains defined by HL7 that correspond to the state machine defined for the                   subject class. For example, Act.status_cd has the domain values which include                   active, suspended, cancelled, completed, and aborted. </body>

Note that the HL7 RIM classes are color coded according their main class   type or stereotype.  Entities play a Role (patient, provider, person, etc.) as they participate in Acts (planned or  unplanned events or actions).  A Participation is an association between an Act  and a Role. The Entity playing the Role is the actor. Each Entity involved in  an Act is linked to the Act by one Participation-instance.  Entities are  depicted in green, Roles in yellow, Acts in light red and Participation in blue.  A description for additiional HL7 Version 3 stereotypes are included in the description of the illustrative classes and attributes included in the diagram below.">

              <body>This is an example attribute declaration. As seen here the attribute name is                     &amp;amp;apos;effectiveTime&amp;amp;apos; and the type of that attribute is &amp;amp;apos;PointInTime&amp;amp;apos;. PointInTime is                     a concrete/implementable class defined in the FHIM Datatypes package. The Class                     notation identifies that PointInTime is a UML class. FHIM domain models reuse                     the data types defined the HL7 Abstract Data Type specification. The stereotype                      TS  specifies that the PointInTime class uses the extensions required for an                     HL7 TS abstract data type. The [0..1] notation specifies the                     cardinality/multiplicity allowed for the effectiveTime attribute by specifying                     the minimum and maximum number of occurrences for this attribute (e.g. minimum 0                     and maximum 1 in this case). To specify that an attribute or association can                     repeat any number of time, the * notation is used for example [0..*] would                     specify that a an attribute may be omitted or it may be repeated without a                     predefined limit. The Default is a cardinality is [1..1] if not otherwise                     specified.</body>

            <body> This directed association describes role that the entity Person plays (as a                   Pilot). An Entity participates in an Act in the guise of a particular Role. Each                   role is &amp;amp;apos;played&amp;amp;apos; by one Entity, called the &amp;amp;apos;player&amp;amp;apos; and is &amp;amp;apos;scoped&amp;amp;apos; by another                   Entity, called the &amp;amp;apos;scoper&amp;amp;apos;. Thus the Role of &amp;amp;apos;Pilot&amp;amp;apos; may be played by a person                   and scoped by the Airline for which the pilot works. Similarly, the Airline scopes                   the &amp;amp;apos;Pilot&amp;amp;apos; role. &amp;amp;gt; The identifier of the Role identifies the Entity playing the                   role in that role. This identifier is assigned by the scoper to the player. The                   scoper NEED NOT have issued the identifier, but MAY have re-used an existing                   identifier. &amp;amp;gt; Most attributes of Role are attributes of the playing entity while                   in the particular role. </body>

            <body>This ActRelationship describes the relationship between FlightSchedule and                   AirFlight. ActRelationship is a directed association between a source Act and a                   target Act (in this case it is a bi-directional association) as specified by the                   HL7 V3 RIM. The relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of                   the source act object. This means that the author of an Act-instance is also                   considered the author of all of the act relationships that have this Act as their                   source, (though not necessarily of the target Acts of those relationships). There                   are no exceptions to this rule. The meaning and purpose of an ActRelationship is                   specified in the ActRelationship.typeCode attribute. Every ActRelationship                   instance is like an arrow with a point (headed to the target) and a butt (coming                   from the source). The functions that source and target Acts play in that                   association are defined for each ActRelationship type differently. For instance,                   in a composition relationship, the source is the composite and the targets are the                   components. In a reason-relationship the source is any Act and the target is the                   reason or indication for the source-Act. </body>

            <body>The HL7 Version 3 definition for Participation class is an association between                   an Act and a Role. The Entity playing the Role is the actor. In this example, the                   Entity Pilot is participating in the Act of an AirFlight in the Role of operator                   of an AirFlight. A Participation represents performance of an Act.</body>

            <body> This is an example subsystem (specified by the  subsystem  stereotype) that                   implements a specific use case as a set of functionality used by business users                   (i.e. actors). It represents independent, behavioral units in a system. Subsystems                   are used in class, component, and use case diagrams to represent large-scale                   components of the system at the center of a interoperability use case.. An entire                   system may be represented as a hierarchy of subsystems. You can also define the                   behavior that each subsystem represents by specifying interfaces to the subsystems                   and the operations that support the interfaces. </body>

              <body>A use case describes a sequence of actions that provide something of                     measurable value to an actor. The use case icon is drawn as a horizontal                     ellipse. A use case in software engineering and systems is a description of a                     system s behavior as it responds to a request that originates from outside that                     system. In other words, a use case describes &amp;amp;apos;who&amp;amp;apos; can do &amp;amp;apos;what&amp;amp;apos; with the system                     in question. The use case technique is used to capture the business domain s                     perspective of a system&amp;amp;apos;s behavioral requirements by detailing scenario-driven                     threads through the functional requirements. </body>

            <body>An actor in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) specifies a role played by a                   user or any other system that interacts with the subject (e.g. subsystem). Actors                   may represent roles played by human users, external hardware, or other subjects.                   Note that an actor does not necessarily represent a specific physical entity but                   merely a particular facet (i.e.,  role ) of some entity that is relevant to the                   specification of its associated use cases. Thus, a single physical instance may                   play the role of several different actors and, conversely, a given actor may be                   played by multiple different instances. Even though UML 2 does not permit                   associations between actors, generalization/specialization relationship between                   actors is useful in modeling overlapping behaviors. </body>
